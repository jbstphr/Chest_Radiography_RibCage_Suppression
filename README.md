- 👀 I’m interesting about 2D-image analysis in linearly-dependent coordinate-axis.
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaboration on intial sample of "👀" in chest-radiography; ribcages' bone subtraction.

step 1a) Copy contents of this folder to c:\VaRibCage\
step 1b) Start ImageJ. Click "Plugins>Macros/Edit" and browse 
         for "C:\ImageJRibCage\RibCage.ijm". Macros-window  (titled "RibCage.ijm")
         with macro-script appears.
step 2a) Open "C:\ImageJRibCage\Example0.DCM". 
step 2b) Click "Macros>Run Macro" in menu of the macros-window. In appearing dialog-box
         click [OK]. Wait 5..30s. Consider new  image-window (titled "$3268x3268.raw").
step 3)  Repeat step2) for "C:\ImageJRibCage\Example1.DCM". It incorrecly detects right
         lung's  area (left on the image) as explained in VaRibCage.rtf section "2.1
         non-working Example1.DCM". 

Note: archive<s> named like WorkingSamples_DCM.zip contain test data series.
